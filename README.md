# AviFavPlus
Adds another favorite menu. Favorites save to your PC so any account you use they will transfer.


# Requirements
- Use [MLEZUpdater](https://github.com/l-404-l/MLEZUpdater) for perfect Installation.
- [0Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony)

# Install
- Join my public releases [discord](https://discord.gg/PMmbwc2) for support

# Known Problems
- Lists over 200-300 create lag (because vrchat creates to many objects on open / scroll)
- When list count less than 0 will keep the last one there. (unless you restart)
